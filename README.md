#Project Summary
A collection of Motorola 68K assembly projects developed in my Structure and Application of Microcomputers course, demonstrating low-level programming skills in serial/DUART communication, interrupt handling, real-time clock logic, mathematical computation, and game logic implemented with modular subroutines, all completed at an assembly level.   

These programs were completed in the EASy68k emulator and uploaded to GitHub.
